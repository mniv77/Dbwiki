# HaGOLEM Wiki - Installation Guide
# Step-by-Step Instructions for Meir

## STEP 1: Set Up the Database

1. Log into your PythonAnywhere account
2. Go to the "Databases" tab
3. Find your MySQL database (or create one if needed)
4. Click "Open MySQL console"

5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `hagolem_wiki_schema.sql` into the console
6. Press Enter to create all tables
7. Verify tables were created:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```
   You should see:
   - hagolem_ideas
   - hagolem_comments
   - hagolem_history

## STEP 2: Update Database Credentials

Open `hagolem_wiki_routes.py` and find this section (around line 11):

```python
def get_db():
    return mysql.connector.connect(
        host='your-mysql-host.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com',
        user='your-username',
        password='your-password',
        database='your-database-name'
    )
```

Replace with YOUR actual credentials:
- host: Found in PythonAnywhere Databases tab (looks like: meirniv.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com)
- user: Your MySQL username (usually same as your PythonAnywhere username)
- password: Your MySQL password
- database: Your database name (usually username$default or similar)

## STEP 3: Add Routes to Your Flask App

Open your `app_min.py` (or `app.py`) file

At the top, make sure you have these imports:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import mysql.connector
from datetime import datetime
```

Then, copy ALL the code from `hagolem_wiki_routes.py` and paste it into your app file
(You can paste it at the end, before the final app.run() line)

## STEP 4: Upload the HTML Template

1. In PythonAnywhere, go to the "Files" tab
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Find or create a folder called `templates`
4. Upload `hagolem_wiki.html` into the templates folder
5. Make sure it's named exactly: `hagolem_wiki.html`

## STEP 5: Test the Installation

1. In PythonAnywhere, go to "Web" tab
2. Click "Reload" button to restart your app
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   https://meirniv.pythonanywhere.com/hagolem/wiki
   ```

You should see the HaGOLEM Wiki interface!

## STEP 6: Add Your First Idea

1. Click the "➕ Add New Idea" button
2. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Idea"
   - Summary: "This is a test to make sure everything works"
   - Full Content: "Testing the wiki system. If you can see this, it works!"
   - Type: Business Strategy
   - Category: Platform
3. Click "💾 Save Idea"

If it saves successfully, everything is working!

## STEP 7: Import Your Existing Ideas

Now you can start adding your ideas from all those files you have!

Two ways to do this:

### Option A: Manual Entry (Recommended to start)
1. Open one of your presentation/document files
2. Copy the content
3. Click "Add New Idea"
4. Paste the content
5. Add title, summary, and categorize it

### Option B: Bulk Import (For many ideas at once)
I'll create a separate import script for you that can read multiple files at once.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "No module named 'mysql.connector'"
Run this in PythonAnywhere Bash console:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python --user
```

### Error: "Table doesn't exist"
Go back to Step 1 and make sure you ran the SQL schema file

### Error: "Can't connect to database"
Check your database credentials in Step 2

### Can't see the page
1. Make sure you reloaded your web app (Web tab → Reload button)
2. Check the error log in the Web tab
3. Make sure the HTML file is in the templates folder

## NEXT STEPS

Once everything is working:

1. Start adding your ideas - one file at a time
2. Add summaries to help you remember what each idea is about
3. Invite others to comment and suggest improvements
4. Use the search to find ideas quickly
5. Tag your ideas so they're easy to find later

## TIPS FOR ORGANIZING YOUR IDEAS

- **Be consistent with categories**: Choose 5-7 main categories and stick to them
- **Write good summaries**: 2-3 sentences that capture the essence
- **Tag liberally**: Add lots of tags so you can search easily
- **Note the source file**: Always include where the idea came from
